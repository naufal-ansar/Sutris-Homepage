            <h2>Russian invasion of Ukraine</h2>
            <p><i>24 February 2022</i></p>
            <p>
              On 24 February 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine in a major escalation of the Russo-Ukrainian War, which began in 2014. The invasion has likely resulted in tens of thousands of deaths on both sides and caused Europe's largest refugee crisis since World War II, with an estimated 8 million people being displaced within the country by late May as well as 7.7 million Ukrainians fleeing the country as of 18 October 2022. Within five weeks of the invasion, Russia experienced its greatest emigration since the 1917 October Revolution. The invasion has also caused global food shortages.</p>

              <p>Following the 2014 Ukrainian Revolution, Russia annexed Crimea, and Russian-backed paramilitaries seized part of the Donbas region of south-eastern Ukraine, which consists of Luhansk and Donetsk oblasts, sparking a regional war. In March 2021, Russia began a large military build-up along its border with Ukraine, amassing up to 190,000 troops and their equipment. Despite the build-up, denials of plans to invade or attack Ukraine were issued by various Russian government officials up to the day before the invasion. On 21 February 2022, Russia recognised the Donetsk People's Republic and the Luhansk People's Republic, two self-proclaimed breakaway quasi-states in the Donbas. The next day, the Federation Council of Russia authorised the use of military force and Russian troops entered both territories.</p>

              <p>The invasion began on the morning of 24 February, when Russian president Vladimir Putin announced a "special military operation" for the "demilitarisation and denazification" of Ukraine. In his address, Putin espoused irredentist views, challenged Ukraine's right to statehood, and falsely claimed Ukraine was governed by neo-Nazis who persecuted the ethnic Russian minority. Minutes later, missiles, rockets and airstrikes hit across Ukraine, including the capital Kyiv, followed by a large ground invasion from multiple directions. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy enacted martial law and a general mobilisation. Russian attacks were initially launched on a northern front from Belarus towards Kyiv, a north-eastern front towards Kharkiv, a southern front from Crimea, and a south-eastern front from Luhansk and Donetsk. Russia's advance towards Kyiv stalled in March, with Russian troops retreating from the northern front by April. On the southern and south-eastern fronts, Russia captured Kherson in March and then Mariupol in May after a siege. On 19 April, Russia launched a renewed attack on the Donbas region, with Luhansk Oblast fully captured by 3 July. Russian forces continued to bomb both military and civilian targets far from the frontline. Ukrainian forces launched counteroffensives in the south in August, and in the northeast in September. Soon after, Russia announced the illegal annexation of four partially occupied Ukrainian oblasts.</p>

              <p>The invasion has received widespread international condemnation. The United Nations General Assembly passed a resolution condemning the invasion and demanding a full withdrawal of Russian forces. The International Court of Justice ordered Russia to suspend military operations and the Council of Europe expelled Russia. Many countries imposed sanctions on Russia, as well as on its ally Belarus, which have affected the economies of Russia and the world, and provided humanitarian and military aid to Ukraine, totalling over $80B from 40 countries as of August 2022. Protests occurred around the world; those in Russia were met with mass arrests and increased media censorship, including a ban on the words "war" and "invasion". Over 1,000 companies have pulled out of Russia and Belarus in response to the invasion. The International Criminal Court has opened an investigation into crimes against humanity in Ukraine since 2013, including war crimes in the 2022 invasion.</p>

              <h2>Conflicts Put Pressure on Energy and Commodity Markets</h2>
              
              <p>Russia is the 3rd producer of oil in the world, the 2nd producer of natural gas and among the top 5 producers of steel, nickel and aluminum. It is also the world's largest exporter of wheat (nearly 20% of global trade). On its side, Ukraine is a major producer of corn (6th largest), wheat (7th), sunflower (1st), and is among the top ten producers of sugar beet, barley, soybean and rapeseed.</p>

              <p>On the day the invasion began, financial markets around the world fell sharply, and prices for oil, natural gas, metals, and food commodities soared. Following recent developments, Brent oil prices breached USD 100 per barrel for the first time since 2014 (125$/b at the time of writing), while European TTF gas prices surged to a record EUR 192 on March 4.</p>

              <p>While high commodity prices are one of the risks that have been identified as potentially disrupting the recovery, the escalation of the conflict increases the likelihood that commodity prices will remain higher for a longer time. In turn, increasing the threat of prolonged high inflation, thereby increasing the risk of stagflation & social unrest in developed & developing countries.</p>

              <p></p>

              <h2>Deep recession ahead for the Russian economy</h2>

              <p>The Russian economy will be in deep trouble in 2022, falling into a deep recession. Coface's updated GDP forecast for 2022 is at -7.5% after the recovery it experienced last year. This led us to downgrade our country risk assessment from B (moderately high) to D (very high).</p>

              <p>The sanctions mainly target major Russian banks, Russia's central bank, Russia's sovereign debt, elected Russian public officials & oligarchs, and control exports of high-tech components to Russia. These measures put considerable downward pressure on the Russian ruble, which has already plummeted, and will prompt a spike in consumer price inflation.</p>

              <p>Russia has built up relatively strong finances: a low level of public external debt, a recurring current account surplus and substantial foreign exchange reserves (about USD 640 billion). However, the freeze imposed by the western depository states on the latter prevented Russia's central bank from spreading it and reduced the effectiveness of Russia's response.</p>

              <p>The Russian economy could benefit from higher commodity prices, particularly for its energy exports. However, the European Union countries announced their intention to limit their imports from Russia. In the industrial sector, limited access to Western-produced semiconductors, computers, telecommunications, automation and information security equipment would be dangerous, given the importance of these inputs in Russia's mining and manufacturing sectors.</p>

              <h2>The European economy is the most at risk</h2>

              <p>Due to its dependence on Russian oil & natural gas, Europe appears to be the region most affected by this conflict. Replacing all of Russia's natural gas supplies to Europe is unlikely in the short to medium term and current price levels will have a significant effect on inflation. At the time of writing, with Brent barrels trading above $125 and natural gas futures showing durable prices above 150€/Mwh, Coface expects at least 1.5 percentage points of additional inflation in 2022 that will erode household consumption and, along with the expected decline in business investment and exports, lowers GDP growth by about one percentage point.</p>

              <p>While Germany, Italy or some countries in Central and Eastern Europe are more dependent on Russian natural gas, the trade interdependence of eurozone countries shows a general slowdown.</p>

              <p>In addition, we predict that a complete cessation of Russian natural gas flows into Europe will increase costs by 4 percentage points by 2022, which will bring annual GDP growth to near zero, more likely in negative territory – depending on demand collapse. management.</p>

              <h2>No region will be spared import inflation and global trade disruption</h2>

              <p>In other parts of the world, the economic consequences will be felt mainly through rising commodity prices, which will trigger pre-existing inflationary pressures. As usual when commodity prices spike, net importers of energy & food products will be severely affected, with the specter of a major supply disruption in the event of a greater escalation of the conflict. Declining demand from Europe will also hamper global trade.</p>

              <p>In Asia-Pacific, the impact will soon be felt through higher import prices, particularly energy prices, with many countries in the region becoming clean energy importers, led by China, Japan, India, South Korea, Taiwan and Thailand.</p>

              <p>As North America's trade and financial relations with Russia and Ukraine are quite limited, the impact of the conflict will be felt mainly through the price channel and through slowing European growth. Despite the prospects for slower economic growth and higher inflation, recent geopolitical events are not expected to derail monetary policy in North America at this stage.</p>
